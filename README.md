Setting up the GLDB-project on CSE VLAB machines

Step 1: Make sure you have enough storage in your system (Around 500MB)

Step 2: Go to GLDB-project directory, open the terminal and run 'make'. This will install nvm if it is not installed yet.

Step 3: Restart your terminal and run 'make' again to make sure npm is installed with nvm.

Step 3: Close your current terminal, and open 2 terminals in the GLDB-project directory.

Step 4: Run the backend by running 'make start_backend' in one of the terminals you've just opened.

Step 5: Run the frontend by running 'make start_frontend' in the other terminal you've opened.

Step 6: You're all setup and ready to use our website. Enjoy!

We recommend you to run the app using Chromium instead of Mozilla Firefox.
