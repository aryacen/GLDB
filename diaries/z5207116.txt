Week 1

We formed our group on the first meeting and introduced ourselves.
We decided to form a rough idea of our roles depending on our code experiences.
We chose a topic by the end of the week (Movie Finder) so we brainstormed some
novel functionalities.
There were no assigned tasks since it was only the first week.




Week 2
This week, we brainstormed user stories and sprints on our local discord server
We also added user stories onto jira and created our github classroom environment
Each of us were then assigned to research which technologies to use in order to build the system.


Week 3


We also had to pick a different novel functionality the tutor suggested something else.
We each presented our ideas and findings on how the system architecture would look like.
I specifically researched how IMBD's and TMDB's public API will interact with our system.
We picked the best ones to put into the proposal.
We had worked on the project proposal.
The main obstacle was getting the proposal done on time due to the minimal timeframe
and disorganisation of planning/distributing tasks.

Planned for next week: have the basic database ready to go so that other functions could be 
assigned to people to complete.
